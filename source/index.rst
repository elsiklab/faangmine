FAANGMine v1.1 Documentation
=============================


**FAANGMine** is a data mining resource that integrates reference genome assemblies for cattle, horse, pig, sheep, chicken, cat, dog and water buffalo with many other biological data sets. Powered by `InterMine <http://intermine.org>`_, this platform provides access to a number of datasets from a variety of source.  It also provides customized bioinformatics tools that researchers can use to create their own custom datasets. FAANGMine is part of `FAANGMine.org <https://faangmine.elsiklab.missouri.edu>`_.  The FAANG (Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes) Consortium is "a coordinated international action to accelerate genome to phenome" and aims to generate comprehensive maps of functional elements in genomes of domesticated animals. FAANGMine will integrate data generated by the FAANG Consortium for animal researchers with or without bioinformatic programming skills to use in their own research projects.
